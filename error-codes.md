# FusionNet Error Codes

This document provides a detailed explanation of all the error codes used in the FusionNet application. It is designed for **developers onboarding to the project**, so they can understand errors, their meaning, and how to handle them.

## Introduction

In any backend system, errors can occur for many reasons: invalid requests, missing data, server issues, or failed business rules.  

FusionNet classifies errors into **two main types**:

1. **HTTP Errors** – Standard HTTP status codes like 404, 500, etc.  
2. **Application Errors** – Custom errors generated by FusionNet for specific business logic or validation rules.  

Using structured error codes makes it easy to **debug issues**, **log problems consistently**, and **communicate errors to the frontend**.

---

## Error Code Structure

### 1. HTTP Errors

These are standard codes defined by the HTTP protocol. Examples:

- `400` → Bad Request  
- `401` → Unauthorized  
- `404` → Not Found  
- `500` → Internal Server Error  

**Tip:** Always check the HTTP code first before looking at custom application errors.

### 2. Application Errors

FusionNet uses a **prefix + number** format for custom errors:

FN###

- **FN** → FusionNet  
- **###** → Unique number identifying the error  

**Example:** `FN002` → Submittal Upload Failed  

**Why:**  
- Distinguishes custom errors from HTTP codes  
- Makes debugging easier  
- Ensures consistent error handling

## HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Name                  | Description                                          | Recommended Action                 |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 400        | Bad Request           | The request is invalid.                              | Check input parameters.           |
| 401        | Unauthorized          | Login required or failed.                            | Provide valid credentials.        |
| 403        | Forbidden             | Access denied.                                      | Check user permissions.           |
| 404        | Not Found             | Resource does not exist.                             | Verify URL or resource ID.        |
| 409        | Conflict              | Resource conflict (e.g., duplicate entry).          | Resolve conflict before retry.    |
| 422        | Unprocessable Entity  | Validation failed (e.g., mandatory fields missing). | Fix the validation errors.        |
| 500        | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server error.                             | Check server logs.                |
| 503        | Service Unavailable   | Temporary server unavailability.                     | Retry later.                      |

> These codes cover all common backend errors in the FusionNet workflow, from **login** → **project creation** → **document upload** → **OCR/Validation** → **review/compliance** → **report generation**.

---

**Explanation for Developers:**  
- Each error code represents a **specific scenario** in the backend.  
- Frontend can use these codes to **show user-friendly messages**.  
- Always log these codes in **backend logs** for easier debugging.

---

## How to Use Error Codes

1. **Backend**:  
   - When a function fails, throw an exception with the **HTTP code** and the **FusionNet error code**.  
   - Example:

   ```json
   {
     "httpStatus": 400,
     "errorCode": "FN002",
     "message": "Submittal upload failed. Please check the file format."
   }
   ```

2. **Frontend**:
    - Check the errorCode to provide specific messages to the user.
    - Optionally, use httpStatus to handle generic errors.

3. **Logging**:
    - Always include the errorCode in server logs.
    - Makes tracing and debugging much faster.


**Examples**
**Example 1**: Submittal Upload Error

```json
{
  "httpStatus": 400,
  "errorCode": "FN002",
  "message": "Submittal upload failed. Please check the file format and try again."
}
```

**Example 2**: Validation Error
```json
{
  "httpStatus": 422,
  "errorCode": "FN004",
  "message": "Document failed validation due to missing mandatory fields."
}
```

**Example 3**: Project Not Found
``` json
{
  "httpStatus": 404,
  "errorCode": "FN001",
  "message": "Project with ID 12345 does not exist."
}
```

## Notes for Onboarding Developers:

- Always use the provided error codes; don’t create new numbers without approval.
- Check both HTTP status and application error code when debugging issues.
- Refer to this document whenever you add new functionality that might fail.
